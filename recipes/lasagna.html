        <h2 class="title-2"><b>Ingredients:</b></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Meat</span>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
            sausage and lean ground beef.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Onion and garlic</span>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are
            cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Tomato products</span> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
            two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Sugar</span> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
            sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Spices and seasonings</span> This lasagna recipe is flavored
            with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning,
            fennel seeds, and black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Lasagna noodles</span>: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
            noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Cheeses</span>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
            this lasagna extra decadent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Egg</span>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
            out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
          </li>
        </ul>
